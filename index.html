			  <div align="left"><pre>GUIDELINES OF BRIDGE MAKING (LOCK & LOAD)

<div align="left"><pre>Event Structure

Maximum no.  Of participants in a team can be 4.
Round 1: The teams shall mail or whatsapp their name to(8175044098)/(9568639981)/ar322744@gmail.comThe abstract should contain the following:

Round 2: The shortlisted teams shall construct their bridge under the surveillance in IEC College. (E-block, Lab Room-E-006 & E-008)
Round 3: The model built by each team will be tested till failure (yielding) by applying an incremental static load.


Materials

A maximum of 200 popsicle sticks can be used to construct the bridge (buy your own)
Only regular, white, all-purpose glue such as Fevicol glue may be used.
No epoxies, contact cement or carpenter’s glue is permitted. A bridge with evidence of glue, other than white glue, being used will not be eligible for prizes.

Dimensions

The Bridge dimensions should be within the specified limits of:

Minimum Total Length = 600mm

Clear Span (distance between inner walls) = 500mm

Height Above bridge deck = 100mm – 200mm

Height Below Bridge deck = 100mm - 150mm
(Bridges must allow 25mm clearance at either end to any framing below the bridge deck)

Width of deck = 80mm – 120mm

A matchbox car (approximately 30 mm wide by 70 mm long by 25mm high) must be capable of being rolled across the bridge deck.

The roadway portion of the bridge should be designed to support the load distribution plate.

The bridge structure is not permitted to apply loading to the vertical faces of the support structure at any time during testing.

4.Testing:

The Judging panel will ensure that each entry complies with the rules above. Only bridges that comply with the rules will be eligible for prizes. Bridges not complying with the rules may not be tested.

Bridges will be weighed before testing.

The load will be applied from below to the mid span of the bridge on the bridge deck. Please ensure adequate reinforcement is provided to transfer the load from the loading plate to the bridge.

Load will be applied until either the bridge breaks or deflects more than 50.mm. The peak load recorded will be considered the failure load.

Bridges will be ranked by two values
Maximum load carried
Highest performance rating = Failure Load / Bridge Weight

All bridges will be destroyed during testing.

All decisions of the Judging Panel will be final.

The testing of all bridges may be photographed and / or videotaped.











5. Examples of kinds of trusses




7. Judging and Scoring

First the structure will be reviewed to check if it violates any rules mentioned above. The scoring of the structure will be based on performance as well as aesthetics:

The bridge will be scored on how well the material has been used to support the load. 

The efficiency will be calculated as the ratio of ultimate load capacity and the bridge weight 

The bridge will also be scored on aesthetics. The judges will judge the bridge based on the detail to connections and members, the uniqueness of the design and its overall look. 

The deflection of the bridge at yielding will be noted. If the deflection increases more than 5 mm.

The Concept of the Bridge Design need to be explained at the time of testing. Candidate may require to explain about how the load is being transferred.




Scoring Criteria 
Deflection at yield (d) = 20%
Efficiency (e) = 50%
Aesthetics (a) = 30%


Total Score (S) = d + e + a
Violating any of the conditions mentioned underneath, penalty will be imposed according to the

Team Specification:

Eligibility: Students of any recognized engineering college are eligible to participate.
Team Specification: Any team can participate in Robowars, INNOVATION 2K18. A team may consist of a maximum of 5 participants. These participants of the team can be of the same/different institution. 
General Rules:
The competition will be played on a knock-out basis consisting of 2-3 players at a time .
The maximum duration of each round will be 5 minutes. Any team that is not ready at the time specified will be disqualified from the competition automatically.
The machine would be checked for its safety before the competition and would be discarded if found unsafe for other participants and spectators.
The organizers reserve the rights to change any or all of the above rules as they deem fit. Change in rules, if any will be highlighted on the website and notified to the registered teams.
Violation of any the above rules will lead to disqualification.
Judges' decision shall be treated as final and binding on all.
Criteria for Triumph:
A robot is declared victorious if its opponent is immobilized or out of the arena.
A robot will be declared immobile if it cannot display linear motion of at least one inch in a timed period of 30 seconds. A bot with one side of its drive train disabled will not be counted out if it can demonstrate some degree of controlled movement.
If both robots survive the five minutes at that point, the robot with the higher hit points wins.
The winner moves on, the loser is eliminated from the tournament.
Safety Rules:
Compliance with all event rules is mandatory. It is expected that competitors stay within the rules and procedures of their own accord and do not require constant policing.
If you have a robot or weapon design that does not fit within the categories set forth in these rules or is in some way ambiguous or borderline, please contact the event organizers.
. All weapons must have a safety cover on any sharp edges
Specifications:
Problem statement:
Design and construct a remote or wired controlled bot capable of fighting a one on one tournament.
Dimensions and Fabrications:
The machine should not exceed 35 kg of weight
The bot should fit in a box of dimension 40cm x 40 cm x 50 cm (lxbxh) with all mechanisms fully executing motions. Length and width is measured to the extremities of the Robot, i.e. includes any overhanging bodywork, weaponry or protrusions. The external device used to control the bot is not included in the size constraint.
Mobility:
All bots must have easily visible and controlled mobility in order to compete. Methods of mobility include:
Rolling (wheels, tracks or the whole robot).
Jumping and hopping is not allowed.
Flying (using airfoil, helium balloons, ornithopters, etc.) is not allowed.
Robot Control Requirements:
• If the bot is wired then the wire should remain slack under all circumstances during the competition. All the wires coming out of the bot should be stacked as a single unit. The wires should be properly insulated.
If the bot is controlled wirelessly, the bot must at least have a four frequency remote control circuit or two dual control circuits which may be interchanged before the start of the race to avoid frequency interference with other teams. The case of any interference in the wireless systems will not be considered for rematch or results.
Remote control systems from toys might be used. Remote control systems available in the market may also be used.
Battery and Power :
The machine can be powered electrically only. Batteries must be sealed, immobilized-electrolyte types (such as Li-ion, NiCd, NiMH or dry cells).
Working voltages must not exceed 24V DC (mean voltage) at any point of time.
All power connections must be of an adequate grade and adequately insulated. Cables must be routed to minimize the chances of being cut.
• All efforts must be made to protect battery terminals from a direct short and causing a battery fire, failure to do so will cause direct disqualification.
DC Power source would be available at the venue.

Motors:
The robot should move as fast as possible around the arena with the help of motors.
DC motors and stepper motors (12V-24V) can be used as per the design of bots</pre></div>

Channel surfing requires you as an individual or as a group to either imitate various channels or come up with something humorous to represent a particular channel. Meanwhile, the judge will keep shifting between channels after every few minutes or seconds.
For example, a judge can switch between HBO, Discovery Channel and MTV within a minute and the student(s) have to imitate any remarkable shows of those channels. Students are judged on spontaneity, content, humor, audience response and coordination (if in a group). To add flavor to this process, sometimes the judge can rewind or fast forward a particular channel thereby forcing the participants to adapt to such changes instantaneously and hilariously.</p>

The event timings will be 10 AM TO 4.30 PM on February 21st to 23rd MARCH, 2018.
There are six players on court in a volleyball team, who each must rotate one position clockwise every time their team wins back service from the opposition. Only the three players at the net positions can jump and spike or block near the net. The backcourt players can only hit the ball over the net if they jump from behind the attack line. 
Most teams will include in their starting line-up a setter, two centre blockers, two receiver-hitters and a universal spiker. 
A team could only win a point if it served the ball. 
Matches are played best of five sets. The first four sets are played to 25 points, with the final set being played to 15 points. A team must win a set by two points. There is no ceiling, so a set continues until one of the teams gains a two-point advantage.

              RULES
Table tennis is played over a pre-agreed number of games and the first to 11 points wins each game.
The toss of a coin or another form of lot-drawing determines which of the players shall serve first.
Each table tennis player serves twice in turn and serves must be made from an open palm, the ball tossed six inches then struck so it bounces on the service side, clears the net, then bounces on the receiver’s side.
Points are decided as described above and games must be won by two clear points. At 10-10 each player serves once only, in turn, until one player established a two point lead and wins the game.
After each game the players rotate both the end of the table from which they are playing as well as who serves and receives the ball first.
In the deciding game of a match the players swap ends after either player reaches five points.

              RULES
Not more than Twelve participants per team.
Cricket is a game played between two teams made up of eleven players each. There is also a reserve player called a “twelfth man” who is used should a player be injured during play.
The twelfth man is not allowed to bowl, bat, wicket keep or captain the team. His sole duty is to act as a substitute fielder.
The original player is free to return to the game as soon as they have recovered from their injury.
To apply the law and make sure the cricket rules are upheld throughout the game there are two umpires in place during games.
Umpires are responsible for making decisions and notifying the scorers of these decisions.
IEC hold’s the right to change these rules and to disqualify any participant for any given reason. 
There are many other cricket rules. However these are most of the basics and will get you well on your way to playing the game. Many of the more advanced rules & laws can be learned along the way and are not vital to general play.</pre></div>

              RULES
For each strike, the player must position the striker within the baseline OR on one of the two circles at either end of the baseline.
A striker within the baseline must touch both the front line and the rear line.
The striker may not "cut the moon" - be placed partially within the baseline and partially within the circle. 
The player must flick the striker with one finger so that it crosses the front baseline - it is not permitted to flick backwards or horizontally. 
A piece that is on or behind the front baseline must not be struck by the striker until the striker has crossed the front baseline.
In striking, the player's hand or arm must not cross the diagonal foul lines at either end of the baseline.
For the very first turn, the player is allowed one attempt to "break" i.e. disturb the central group of counters.
It doesn't matter which piece the striker hits first and it doesn't matter if the striker hits no pieces.
If the player pockets no pieces or commits a foul, the turn finishes.
A player may only pocket and cover the Queen if that player has already pocketed at least one piece of that player's colour.
Should a player pocket the Queen before being permitted to cover it, the turn continues but the Queen is returned to the centre at the end of the turn.
When a player pockets the Queen but does not cover it, the Queen is returned as near as possible to the centre circle by the opponent.
Pieces returned to the centre can be placed on top of other pieces within the main circle.

              RULES
A game starts with a coin toss. Whoever wins the toss gets to decide whether they would serve or receive first OR what side of the court they want to be on. The side losing the toss shall then exercise the remaining choice.
At no time during the game should the player touch the net, with his racquet or his body.
The shuttlecock should not be carried on or come to rest on the racquet.
A player should not reach over the net to hit the shuttlecock.
A serve must carry cross court (diagonally) to be valid.
During the serve, a player should not touch any of the lines of the court, until the server strikes the shuttlecock. During the serve the shuttlecock should always be hit from below the waist.
A point is added to a player's score as and when he wins a rally.
A player wins a rally when he strikes the shuttlecock and it touches the floor of the opponent's side of the court or when the opponent commits a fault. The most common type of fault is when a player fails to hit the shuttlecock over the net or it lands outside the boundary of the court.
Each side can strike the shuttlecock only once before it passes over the net. Once hit, a player can't strike the shuttlecock in a new movement or shot.
The shuttlecock hitting the ceiling is counted as a fault.
